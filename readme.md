## Notes after Discussion(Sprint 1)

 - Movement cost in the 3D grid are assigned as:
	- Distance between two nodes sharing a side is 10
	- Distance between two nodes sharing an edge is 14
	- Distance between two nodes sharing a vertex is 17
 - Include an option to select map.
 - Implement a path planning function to publish the path by comparing the total costs of each node.
